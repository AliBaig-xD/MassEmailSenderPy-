# MassEmailSenderPy-
**This simple script will allow you to send mass emails in plain text format or HTML using python.**

This script is implemented using the **smtplib** module which come built-in with python. What it does is simply connects with your smtp server and asks user for the details to be sent in the email. The UI is not so efficient but you will get along. 

First of all, Open **config.py** and configure the smtp

That pretty much it for the configuration. After that open **Mailer.py**.  You will get option to choose email format

After that enter the location of you mail list. Make sure the mail list is such that there is only one email in one line.
if the emails are in some other format, you can refer to my script to separate emails to get the mail list in the given format

After that enter the sender's email, the subject line and the location of your email in **.txt** or **html**
